# Snocast
This repo contains code to download data and train a model to predict snow water equivalent (SWE) values for 1 km^2 grids in the Western United States. It also contains code to use the trained model to make near real-time predictions for SWE.

This code is designed to run using Google Colab with Google Drive as a backend for storing data. The Google Colab notebooks in this repo assume that the directory structure below stems from a root of `/content/drive/MyDrive/snocast` and files are accessed from a Google Colab notebook after the google drive has been mounted.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Train Instructions
In order to train the SWE prediction model a large quantity of historical data must be pulled into the directory structure above and then processed for the model. We assume that the following files will be manually downloaded from the [DrivenData website](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/86/competition-reclamation-snow-water-eval/data/) and placed in the `train/data/static` directory.
* `ground_measures_train_features.csv`
* `ground_measures_test_features.csv`
* `ground_measures_metadata.csv`
* `train_labels.csv`
* `labels_2020_2021.csv`
* `submission_format.csv`
* `grid_cells.geojson`

With the base files - listed above - in place we use the notebooks with the `get_` prefix to acquire the remaining data necessary to train the SWE prediction model. For the sake of prediction the data are separated into two main categories, static and time-sensitive. Static data sources do not vary between prediction windows and represent geographical features of the grid cell. The time-varying data sources capture SWE features that will vary for a particular grid cell throughout the snow season. The three time-varying data sources are:
* Modis
* NOAA HRRR Climate Data
* Ground Measurements 

We will start by pulling the static data sources.
Note: when training the data all the sources are technically static since we are looking at historical measurements.

### Static Data for Train
Run the following notebooks in the `train` directory in any particular order. Some of the notebooks will require an AWS access key and secret, noted below.
* `get_water_bodies_train_test.ipynb` (requires AWS access key)
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `train/data/static/train_water.parquet`
    * `train/data/static/test_water.parquet`
* `get_lccs_train_test.ipynb` (requires AWS access key)
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `train/data/static/train_lccs.parquet`
    * `train/data/static/test_lccs.parquet`
* `get_lccs_gm.ipynb` (requires AWS access key)
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `train/data/static/train_gm.parquet`
* `get_elevation_train_test.ipynb`
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `train/data/static/train_elevation.parquet`
    * `train/data/static/test_elevation.parquet`
* `get_elevation_gradient_all.ipynb`
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `train/data/static/train_elevation_grads.parquet`
    * `train/data/static/test_elevation_grads.parquet`

### Modis Data for Train
Run the `get_modis_all.ipynb` notebook. This notebook will require access to [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine). Since this notebook pulls data for each date in the train, test, and gm datasets, and the 15 days prior to each date, this notebook takes a very long time to run. Occassionally an error on the Colab Server or with the Google Earth Engine API will cause the program to quit. It is recommended to run the Colab notebook with Background Execution enabled and a High-RAM runtime.

**Outputs:** 
* Ground Measure Modis Data
  * `train/data/modis/modis_terra_gm.parquet`
  * `train/data/modis/modis_aqua_gm.parquet`
* Train Modis Data
  * `train/data/modis/modis_terra_train.parquet`
  * `train/data/modis/modis_aqua_train.parquet`
* Test Modis Data
  * `train/data/modis/modis_terra_test.parquet`
  * `train/data/modis/modis_aqua_test.parquet`

### NOAA HRRR Climate Data for Train
Run the `get_climate_all.ipynb` notebook. Since this notebook pulls data for each date in the train, test, and gm datasets, and the 3 days prior to each date, this notebook takes a very long time to run. Occassionally an error on the Colab Server or with the HRRR data storage locations will cause the program to quit. It is recommended to run the Colab notebook with Background Execution enabled and a High-RAM runtime.

**Outputs:** 
* Ground Measure Climate Data - `train/data/hrrr/gm_climate.parquet`
* Train Climate Data - `train/data/hrrr/train_climate.parquet`
* Test Climate Data - `test/data/hrrr/test_climate.parquet`

### Train the Model on the Acquired Data
Run the `train_model.ipynb` notebook. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]()

This notebook will collate the data sources pulled in the previous steps, create relevant features for the model and finally train the model for SWE prediction.

**Outputs:** 
* Standard Scaler fit on the train data - `eval/models/std_scaler.bin`
  * Used to ensure that data scaling is similar when the model is run for prediction.
* XGBoost Model fit on the train data - `eval/models/xgb_all.txt`
  * Used as part of prediction ensemble.
* LGB Model fit on train data - `eval/models/lgb_all.txt`
  * Used as part of prediction ensemble. 

## Prediction (Eval) Instructions
We assume that the following files will be manually downloaded from the [DrivenData website](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/86/competition-reclamation-snow-water-eval/data/) and placed in the `eval/data` directory.
* `ground_measures_metadata.csv`
* `submission_format.csv`
* `grid_cells.geojson`

Place the following files in the `eval/data/ground_measures` directory.
* `ground_measures_train_features.csv`
* `ground_measures_test_features.csv`

With the base files - listed above - in place we use the notebooks with the `get_` prefix to acquire the remaining data necessary to use the SWE prediction model. Just like in the training scenario, we've broken the data into two main categories (1) static - which need to be run once - and (2) time-varying - which need to be run with every prediction.

### Static Data for Eval
Run the following notebooks in the `eval` directory in any particular order. Some of the notebooks will require an AWS access key and secret, noted below.
* `get_water_bodies_eval.ipynb` (requires AWS access key)
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `eval/data/static/grid_water.parquet`
* `get_lccs_eval.ipynb` (requires AWS access key)
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `eval/data/static/grid_lccs.parquet`
* `get_elevation_eval.ipynb`
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `eval/data/static/grid_cells_elev.parquet`
* `get_elevation_gradient_eval.ipynb`
  * **Outputs:** 
    * `eval/data/static/test_elevation_grads.parquet`

### Ground Measures for Eval
Run the `get_ground_measures_eval.ipynb` notebook which will pull the latest `ground_measures_features.csv` file from the `drivendata-public-assets` AWS S3 bucket and store it in the `eval/data/ground_measures` directory.

### Modis Data for Eval
There are two options options for pulling Modis data from Google Earth Engine. The first option is the notebook `get_modis_eval.ipynb`. This notebook is similar to the way we pulled data in the Train scenario. Simply make sure the `run_date` variable is set to the current prediction date and execute all the cells in order. `run_date` should be a string with `%Y-%m-%d` date format. It takes about 4 hours to run. 

However, the Google Earth Engine data for Modis Terra and Aqua typically lags 2.5 days behind. So we may find ourselves in a situation where we want to pull the most up-to-date Modis data but we only have a few hours before the submission deadline. In this case, we can use hte `get_modis_eval_parallel.ipynb` notebook which can speed up the Modis data acquisition 5x by running data pull jobs in parallel. This notebook relies on the `modis_parallel.py` file and also assumes that you have set up a [Google service account](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account) with access to Earth Engine and pulled down the credentials file into your notebook (for automatic authentication).

**Outputs:** 
* Modis Data for Prediction `run_date`
  * `eval/data/modis/modis_terra_{run_date}.parquet`
  * `eval/data/modis/modis_aqua_{run_date}.parquet`

### NOAA HRRR Climate Data for Train
Next, open the `get_climate_eval.ipynb` notebook. Make sure to change the `run_date` variable to the current date for submitting predictions. `run_date` should be a string with `%Y-%m-%d` date format. Then run the notebook to generate the climate data which will be save to the `eval/data/hrrr` directory with the following format `climate_{run_date}.parquet`.

**Outputs:** 
* Eval Climate Data - `eval/data/hrrr/climate_{run_date}.parquet`

### Use Trained Model to Predict SWE
Run the `model_predict_eval.ipynb` notebook.

This notebook collates the data sources pulled in the previous steps, creates relevant features for the model and finally uses the previously trained models for SWE prediction.

**Outputs:** 
* Submission File - `eval/submissions/submission_{run_date}.csv`
